## What next?

- You could make the game more interesting by adding extra sprites for Mooncake to reach. Perhaps some of them could give her a speed boost or slow her down. Adding obstacles could also be a fun way to add more excitement to your game.

- Check out some of our other [space-themed projects](https://astro-pi.org/resources/).
