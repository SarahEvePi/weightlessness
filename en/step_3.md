## Weightlessness: Mooncake in Space

In space, it feels like everything is floating. This is because everything becomes **weightless** outside of our planet, Earth. This is probably the biggest difference from being on Earth, where everything and everybody is pulled down towards the ground. On Earth, we can all feel this downward pull, but we're so used to it that we sometimes don't even think about it. This pull or attraction we feel is called **gravity**.

You can recreate the effects of weightlessness in space in this Scratch game, either by using [Scratch online](https://scratch.mit.edu/) from a Computer or by using Scratch on the Raspberry Pi.
