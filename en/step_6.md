## Adding movement

As Mooncake is in space, she would be experiencing the effects of weightlessness and float about. We've given her a jetpack so that she can change direction, thanks to a source of energy. Without a jetpack or anything to push against, Mooncake would just keep going in one direction!

- With the Astro Cat sprite selected, click on the control blocks and add a `when I receive` block to the stage. Select **start** from the drop-down list. Remember that this is the message that is broadcast by your first script.

- Next, add a `forever` looping block underneath.

- Add a `move 2 steps` block inside the `forever` loop.

- Save your work so far and click on the green flag to test your scripts work as expected. Mooncake should move in one direction until she reaches the edge of the stage.
