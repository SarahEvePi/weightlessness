## What you will make
In this activity, you will learn how to simulate the effects of weightlessness in space with this Scratch game, as well as computer science concepts like sequencing, looping, variables, and conditionals. 

You can learn more about the forces of gravity and the effects of weightlessness, as well as more about British ESA Astronaut Tim Peake's mission aboard the International Space Station, on [the UK National STEM Centre website here](http://www.nationalstemcentre.org.uk/timpeake).

## What you will learn
By creating a weightlessness space game in Scratch, you will learn:

- About the force of gravity and weightlessness in space
- How to import images into Scratch, and use them as backgrounds and sprites
- How to store data in variables
- How to use loops
- How to set and use conditionals
- How to use operators
- How to repeat a background in a game using wrapping
- How to create a game over screen
