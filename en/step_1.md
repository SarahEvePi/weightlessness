## Introduction

Create a Scratch game to simulate the effects of weightlessness in space. 

You will:

- Simulate weightlessness using a `forever`{:class="block3control"} loop and `point in direction`{:class="block3motion"} blocks
- Add and edit a 'Game Over' backdrop then `switch backdrop`{:class="block3looks"} using code
- Use the Scratch `timer`{:class="block3sensing"} variable and make your own `score variable`{:class="block3variables"} to create a game
