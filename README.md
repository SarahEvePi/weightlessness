# Weightlessness Space Game

![](cover.png)

In this activity, you will learn how to simulate the effects of weightlessness in space with this Scratch game, as well as computer science concepts like sequencing, looping, variables, and conditionals.

You can learn more about the forces of gravity and the effects of weightlessness, as well as more about British ESA Astronaut Tim Peake's mission aboard the International Space Station, on [the UK National STEM Centre website here](http://www.nationalstemcentre.org.uk/timpeake).
